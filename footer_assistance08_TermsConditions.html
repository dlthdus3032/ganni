                                <p>Subject to applicable law, the user has the right to withdraw from the contract without giving any reason within 14 days of delivery.

                                <p>For contracts where multiple products are ordered in one order with partial shipments (i.e. partial shipments), the withdrawal period will expire 14 days from the date of: 1&#41; The date the last product was actually obtained by the user or a third party designated by the user other than the shipping company 2&#41; The date the last product was delivered to the destination of the shipping company selected by the user when placing the order</p>

                                <p>If you exercise your right of withdrawal, you must notify GANNI of your intention to use your right of withdrawal by a clear statement (e.g. letter sent by mail, fax or e-mail). Users can take advantage of the return guide and prepaid return label included in the package. The withdrawal deadline will be met if the notice of withdrawal is sent before the expiration of the withdrawal period. More details can be found here.</p>
                                <p>If you exercise your right to withdraw as above, you must return the applicable GANNI Goods without undue delay, in any event, within 14 days from the date you communicated your withdrawal to us.</p>

                                    If the user wishes to withdraw from the contract, GANNI shall, in any event, within 14 days from the date of notification of the decision to withdraw from the contract, without undue delay, at the cost of delivery (indirect due to the type of delivery selected by the user in addition to the standard delivery type with the lowest cost presented by us).

No fees will be incurred for these refunds under any circumstances. If a GANNI gift card was used as a payment method, the payment amount will be refunded to the GANNI gift card. If you paid for part of your order with a GANNI gift card, the amount paid with your GANNI gift card will be refunded to your GANNI gift card, and the remaining amount will be refunded to your selected payment method.</p>
                                <p>If the user uses the return label included with the order, GANNI will cover the return cost. Please pack the GANNI products you wish to return in a single, labeled package.</p>
